The blog is to record my knowledge I learn during my career of software development. 
By this blog, I hope to share what I experience to community and hope to improve the knowledge continuously via this interaction

At the time of publishing the blog, I was a more than 10 years Java developer, but started falling in love with Scala and its echosystem and also Docker technology in DevOps
So this blog is probably all about Scala and Docker stuffs, but not strictly.

You love Scala or Docker? Join me :)
